# Docker Container for Nmap

# Summary

[Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/) image with [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed.

# Description

Python is a great programming language. It can be useful to have a fresh system available on demand when the need to test something in Python presents itself. This Docker container allows one to initialise a very small container (thanks to Alpine) for this purpose.
